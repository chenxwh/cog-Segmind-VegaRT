Segmind-VegaRT is a distilled consistency adapter for [Segmind-Vega](https://huggingface.co/segmind/Segmind-Vega) that allows
to reduce the number of inference steps to only between **2 - 8 steps**.
Latent Consistency Model (LCM) LoRA was proposed in [LCM-LoRA: A universal Stable-Diffusion Acceleration Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05556) 
by *Simian Luo, Yiqin Tan, Suraj Patil, Daniel Gu et al.*
